# ChiselEngine
Chisel Engine is a OpenXR Game Engine that is being developed for my Steam game - Rock Life: The Rock Simulator 

## Instructions 
Since this is project is working of a Solution (.sln) file, I recommend to use Visual Studio 2022

Ensure you have the C++ and DirectX Package Installed (You will be shown these as option in the Visual Studio Installer)

Using Visual Studio, you will need to Install the following NuGet packages: 

**OpenXR.Loader** \
**OpenXR.Headers (Should download along with OpenXR.Headers)**

Before running, make sure you have an instance of OpenXR running along with a connected VR Headset or MR Device.

## Preview and Features

- OpenXR and DirectX implemented (Moving to OpenGL Rendering)
- Desktop Window to Display what is shown on the VR Headset via OpenXR (Two Swapchains)
- Controller detection and input support
